What is Gw2BBCode ?
-------------------

Gw2BBCode is javascript plugin, which extends capability of GW2DB Tooltip. It converts (on the fly) Guild Wars 2 skill's names (traits, condition & boons) into icons. It can also show tooltip with description over the icon. Tooltips content comes from GW2DB.


How to use it ?
---------------

* All you need to do is write resource's name in brackets:

	`[Charge], ["Fear Me!"], [Ember's Might], [Poison], [Swiftness]`.


* Need resource's name instead of icon? It's simple! Just add `@` just after first brackets:

	`[@Charge], [@"Fear Me!"], [@Ember's Might], [@Poison], [@Swiftness]`.


* There is more than one resource with the same name? (Disabling Shot shortbow and harpoon gun skill).

    `the first one:  [Disabling Shot] or [Disabling Shot.1]`

    `the second one: [Disabling Shot.2]`
